            This list has been compiled to guide you on packing for your trip. The brands recommended are not
            required as different brands fit different than others. We highly recommend starting to shop months in
            advanced in order to allow enough time to choose wisely and get proper fitting equipment. Do not wait
            until the last minute. We understand this gear is expensive so shop around and look for sales, especially
            after the winter season has ended in your local area. Once you have this equipment it can be used for
            years on mountains similar in height, in any range throughout the world.
